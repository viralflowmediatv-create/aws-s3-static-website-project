# AWS S3 Static Website Project

This is my first AWS project for learning cloud fundamentals.  
The goal is to host a simple static website using **Amazon S3** and deliver it globally using **CloudFront**.

## 📌 What I Learned
- How S3 works
- How to enable static website hosting
- How CloudFront speeds up content delivery
- How to document projects using GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🌐 Website Description
A simple HTML page deployed on AWS S3 as part of my cloud learning journey.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add CloudFront distribution  
- Add custom domain  
- Expand website features

# 🎉 **You’re Done!**

You’ve now created:
- Your first GitHub repository  
- A project structure  
- A website folder  
- An index.html file  
- A professional README.md  

This is EXACTLY how beginners start building a cloud portfolio.
